# odin-bst

This project provides a binary search tree (BST) implementation in JavaScript using the Node and Tree classes.
It allows for building and manipulating BSTs with features such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and tree balancing.

All values are coerced to numbers for type consistency across the tree.
